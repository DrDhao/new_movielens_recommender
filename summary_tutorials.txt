Tutorial 1:
    The first tutorial is about backpropagation.
    Backpropagation is the method of how a network is trained by knowing the ground truth and going back from there.
    It uses the derivate to calculate the adjustment of the parameters of each layer.
    In the tutorial we first made our own version ( that was tediuos) and later used the tensorflow lib.

Tutorial 2:
    Using a pretrainged model to use the knowlege of a model trained on a big dataset to improve our code.
    To use the model for feature extraction we freeze the parameters of the pretrained model.

Tutorial 3:
    We used the U-net architecture. To evaluate we used the dice coeffcient loss, that compares two "quantities".
    For training we used a data generator.
